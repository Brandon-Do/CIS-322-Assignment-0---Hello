What does Git do?

Git is a cloud software platform that enables software engineers to collaborate on a singular software project seamlessly.
This is because Git takes the base project and detects any differences between each new version that each engineer works on.
Each individual difference is integrated in the project and each integration is documented.

This allows for each version to be documented and recoverable, which enables software teams to backtrack as well if any
mistakes are made.
